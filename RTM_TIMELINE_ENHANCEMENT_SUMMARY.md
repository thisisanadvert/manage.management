# RTM Timeline Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive enhancement to the RTM Formation Tools that transforms the basic timeline into a **smart, date-driven process manager** with automated deadline calculations, evidence collection, and real-time progress tracking.

## ‚úÖ What We've Built

### 1. **Enhanced Database Schema** 
- `rtm_milestones` - Tracks each milestone with completion dates, deadlines, and dependencies
- `rtm_evidence` - Stores uploaded documents with service details and verification status
- `rtm_timeline_progress` - Overall progress tracking with calculated deadlines
- Automated deadline calculation functions
- Comprehensive RLS policies for security

### 2. **RTM Timeline Service** (`src/services/rtmTimelineService.ts`)
- Manages milestone completion and deadline calculations
- Handles evidence uploads and verification
- Automatically calculates statutory deadlines (3 months for acquisition, 1 month for counter-notice)
- Tracks progress and updates timeline state

### 3. **Enhanced Timeline Component** (`src/components/rtm/EnhancedRTMTimeline.tsx`)
- Visual timeline with real-time progress indicators
- Countdown timers for critical deadlines
- Evidence upload functionality per milestone
- Completion date tracking
- Urgent deadline alerts

### 4. **Evidence Collection System**
- **EvidenceUploadModal** - Full-featured document upload with service details
- **EvidenceList** - Display uploaded evidence with verification status
- Support for proof of postage, service certificates, claim notice copies
- Service method tracking (recorded delivery, hand delivery, email)
- Document verification workflow

### 5. **Automated Deadline Calculator** (`src/components/rtm/RTMDeadlineCalculator.tsx`)
- Calculates acquisition date (3 months after claim notice service)
- Tracks counter-notice deadline (1 month after claim notice)
- Manual date calculation tools
- Statutory compliance validation

### 6. **Progress Dashboard** (`src/components/rtm/RTMProgressDashboard.tsx`)
- Comprehensive overview with key metrics
- Next action alerts with countdown timers
- Key dates summary (claim notice, counter-notice deadline, acquisition date)
- Recent activity tracking
- Tabbed interface (Overview, Timeline, Deadlines)

### 7. **Integration with Existing Tools**
- Updated RTM Dashboard to use new progress dashboard
- Enhanced RTM Management page with new timeline options
- Seamless integration with existing RTM formation components
- Backward compatibility maintained

## üöÄ Key Features Implemented

## üìä How It Works

### **Timeline Flow**
1. **Initialization** - Default milestones created for building
2. **Eligibility Assessment** - Mark complete with evidence
3. **Company Formation** - Upload Companies House certificate
4. **Claim Notice Service** - Upload proof of postage ‚Üí Auto-calculates deadlines
5. **Counter-Notice Period** - 30-day countdown begins
6. **Acquisition** - 90 days after claim notice service

### **Deadline Calculations**
```
Claim Notice Served: [User Selected Date]
    ‚Üì
Counter-Notice Deadline: +30 days (automatic)
    ‚Üì
Acquisition Date: +90 days (automatic)
```

### **Evidence Requirements**
- **Eligibility**: Building documents, management agreements
- **Formation**: Companies House certificate, articles of association
- **Claim Notice**: Proof of postage, service certificates, recipient lists
- **Acquisition**: Handover documents, account transfers

## üéÆ Demo & Testing

### **Interactive Demo** (`RTMTimelineTest.tsx`)
- Shows complete timeline with mock data
- Demonstrates all key features
- Interactive milestone completion
- Evidence upload simulation
- Deadline calculations in action

### **Access Points**
