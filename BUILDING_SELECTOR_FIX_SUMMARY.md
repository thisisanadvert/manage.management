# Building Selector Fix Summary üåô

## Problem Identified
The building selector dropdown shows "No buildings found" even though:
- ‚úÖ User authentication is working
- ‚úÖ Building_users records exist (4 records for management company)
- ‚úÖ BuildingContext successfully queries building_users table
- ‚ùå BuildingContext fails when querying buildings table (RLS policy issue)

## Root Cause
**Row Level Security (RLS) policy on the `buildings` table is blocking the SELECT query.**

The console shows:
- BuildingContext finds 4 building_users records ‚úÖ
- BuildingContext fails to fetch buildings data ‚ùå
- Error likely related to RLS policy preventing access

2. **fix_building_selector_rls.sql** - Comprehensive diagnostic script
3. **quick_building_fix.sql** - Immediate fix script

## Quick Fix (Run This First!)
```sql
